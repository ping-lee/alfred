For a long time, the question of entering a higher school has been lingering in my mind.

### Graduate enrollment expansion
This month, announced by the [Ministry of Education](http://edu.people.com.cn/n1/2020/0302/c1053-31612535. HTML) the enrollment scale of Postgraduates in 2020 increased by 189000 this year compared with last year, a year-on-year increase of 20%. According to the national economic and social development statistics bulletin 2019 released by the National Bureau of statistics, 917000 graduate students will be enrolled in 2019. According to this calculation, after the enrollment expansion, this year's graduate enrollment scale may reach 1.1 million people.

Class|Recruit|In|Graduate
-|-|-|-
Graduate student|91.7|2864|64.0
General College|914.9|3031.5|758.5
Secondary vocational education|600.4|1576.5|493.4
Ordinary high school|839.5|2414.3|789.2
Junior school student|1638.8|4827.1|1454.1
Ordinary primary school|1869.0|10561.2|1647.9

This is to implement the requirements of the State Council. Because of the epidemic this year, the employment situation of college graduates is very severe. Expanding the enrollment of Postgraduates can reduce the employment pressure.

This is a necessary measure, but it also reflects the reality of our country: `the purpose of higher education is not to train academic talents completely, but to a large extent, it serves as a buffer layer for employment.`

Once employment is not good, colleges and universities will expand their enrollment. As a result of repeated enrollment expansion, the quality of postgraduate training has declined dramatically.

These years, it has become common for doctoral students to take civil service examinations and apply for primary and secondary school teachers. Almost any job with academic qualifications, there are doctoral candidates in the application. The degree of the devaluation of education can be seen.

In my opinion, graduate education is becoming more and more unworthy. The graduate diploma is devaluing, and the knowledge learned can be self-taught on the Internet. Working and studying at the same time will cost much less than going to graduate school. In the work, improve skills, understand the society, and more importantly, have income; after work, self-study through the network, supplement knowledge, and think about their future direction. In short, China's graduate education is not the way out, learning too little, wasting too much time.

### Decrease of benchmark interest rate

The US recently cut its benchmark interest rate [to 0%](https://finance.sina.com.cn/money/bond/market/2020-03-26/doc-iimxyqwa3220083.shtml). I think people don't pay much attention to this matter. They think it has nothing to do with themselves or it's a temporary measure.

The opposite is true. I think it's one of the most important long-term economic signs that will have an impact on everyone and will be more profound and lasting than the epidemic itself.

It shows one thing that the era of high interest rates is over forever. Interest rates in the U.S. have fallen to zero, and in China they are falling. Even in Europe last year they were negative. This is by no means temporary. We will face low interest rates for a long time.


Interest rate is the cost of capital. A low interest rate means a cheap fund. You can borrow money at a very low price. In turn, it also reflects the average profit margin of the society. If the profit margin of various projects is very high and the interest rate is very low, more people will borrow money, so as to promote the recovery of interest rate.

`The falling interest rate just shows that the average profit margin of the society is declining.`Generally speaking, good projects that can make money are more and more difficult to find.

Here's how it affects everyone: `the disappearance of high return projects, the fall in interest rates and the slowdown in economic growth make it difficult for you to save money.`It's not easy for you to accumulate a little salary, but you can't find a high return investment way at all. No matter it's bank deposit, securities investment or project investment, the return rate is very low.

Because the return on investment is very low, most people's wealth can only be accumulated mainly by salary. Once there is a big consumption or life change, that money will disappear. So for young people, if they want to live independently, they must start working as soon as possible and get paid. The later you work, the more difficult the economic situation will be, because you can't find a way to quickly accumulate funds, and the age is growing, but the asset growth is very slow.

Should I go to graduate school? I think it's really too late to wait until you're 24 to graduate and find your first job in the job market. At least during the period of postgraduate study, we should find ways to earn money.

The above point of view is quoted from Ruan Yifeng's article. At the end of reading, he is explaining the things before and after entering the University. However, there is no negative statement when facing the question of whether to enter the University, so it's no doubt that he will enter the University!

I also believe that in view of personal and social competitiveness, the post-90s generation urgently need to pursue `fixed assets and quantitative indicators`.
